# Twitter-Together Project Guide

A guide to creating and publishing content to the Ethereum Classic Community's social media assets

## Introduction

Ethereum Classic, the original Ethereum blockchain, is governed only by the principles upon which it was founded. One of these core principles is decentralization. The Ethereum Classic Community, in an effort to decentralize control over its social media assets, to reduce the risk of having those assets hijacked by former trusted parties turned bad actors, and to encourage increased participation from the community, has adopted and refined the Twitter-Together Github action to publish content to its assets on the Twitter platform and other social media outlets.

This guide covers how content is created, reviewed, published and distributed throughout the social media outlets on which Ethereum Classic has a presence. It will provide community members with a simple, non-technical method they can use to suggest Tweets for Ethereum Classic's Twitter accounts to publish. The content creation section lists the general rules and style guidelines for the various accounts this project serves. For those interested in a deeper level of participation, the Reviewers section details the content review and approval process. No matter what your level of technical know-how, if you wish to help give voice to the Ethereum Clasic ecosystem and promote the public's awareness of all things ETC, this guide will show you how.

## Why We Twitter Together

The Ethereum Classic community is no stranger to adversity. Ethereum Classic came to be during the adversity of a contentious hard-fork with which the Ethereum Foundation abandoned the core concepts of the immutable blockchain and "Code Is Law". From that abandonment, however, a wonderful thing happened. The voice of a new community arose, an independant community whose battlecries were the very concepts the Ethereum Foundation had forsaken.

**_"Immutable! Unstoppable! Decentralized! Code Is Law!"_**

With those core fundamentals as its guide, this community of abandoned idealists took up the reins of the original Ethereum blockchain, now branded Classic, and continued forward without the Ethereum Foundation toward its goal of building a blockchain ecosystem having the foundational principles of Bitcoin with the functionality of smart contracts through the Ethereum Virtual Machine.

 Since that "re-beginning," the Ethereum Classic community has grown and grown stronger as they have faced test after test challenging their resolve to uphold those core concepts which brought them together. One of those tests occurred when a high-profile trusted member of the community became embittered toward the community and ETC in general. He began a campaign of disinformation in an apparent attempt to disrupt development of the Ethereum Classic project and to cause the community to feel disillusioned and defeated. He used the community's own asset, its verified Twitter account with over 60,000 followers, the keys to which had been entrusted to him and were under his control, against the community both indirectly by withholding it from use and directly by publishing content which was intended to harm rather than promote the Ethereum Classic project. As a coup de gr√¢ce, after several failed rounds of requests that control of the account be returned to the community, this once trusted bad actor gave the account, along with its over 60,000 followers, to a competing blockchain project leaving the ETC community to start over with a newly created Twitter account, zero followers, no verification, and no history.

 It is to mitigate the chances that this or something like it can happen in the future that the Ethereum Classic community adopted the Twitter-Together software as part of an initiative to better protect the community's assets. Many have blamed the bad actor for the loss of the verified Twitter accout and the long rebuilding process the community now faces. With his actions and his words, he has revealed his true character and made it plain to see that the community is stronger without his influence. On a deeper level, however, it is througb the community's own failure to act in accordance with its espoused core principles that gave opportunity for this to happen at all. For whatever reason it was allowed to be so, be it convenience, misplaced trust, time constraints, or something else completely unexpected, the fact is that an asset such as a Twitter account with one person oversight and management is a centralized weakness easily exploited; the very antithesis of that which a community dedicated to the concept of decentralization should have identified and remedied.

 With this rebuilding of its social media presence, the community will apply all it has learned through this and all the other adversities it has had to overcome. With a renewed resolve to root out centralization wherever possible and to mitigate its effects where it cannot be removed, through the utilization of new technology tools and multiple layers of redundancy, the Ethereum Classic community's voice will not be silenced again.

## What this project is

Twitter-Together is the open-source software used by the Ethereum Classic community to collaboratively control an ETC-branded presence on the Twitter social media platform. This is done to further the community's goal of maximizing decentralization wherever possible. Unfortunately, Twitter is by design a centralized platform. A Twitter handle has one set of "keys" making it, in practice, "owned" by an individual and therefore centralized. The Ethereum Classic community has experienced benevolent "owners" of community assets (such as a Twitter handle or GitHub repository) becoming bad actors, using the community's assets under their control against the good of Ethereum Classic, causing much stress and disharmony within the community, and presenting a less than ideal, unprofessional, or downright damaging image of Ethereum Classic to the "follower" public. Use of the Twitter-Together software is one aspect of the community's ongoing attempt to mitigate the chances that such misuse of community assets can occur in the future, to promote more opportunities for involvement from the community in general, and to further its goals of maximized decentralization in all possible areas.

## What this project is not

**_This is not the "official" Twitter handle for Ethereum Classic._**

* The Ethereum Classic community rejects the creation of any "official" centralized point of information speaking for the blockchain itself or the community as a whole.

**_This is not a platform for Ethereum Classic to endorse or certify any project, dApp, company or individual in any capacity whatsoever._**

* Announcements of projects', dApps', companies' or individuals' newsworthy contributions to the Ethereum Classic ecosystem, without any "official" approval of the entity or product, are a proper use of this information channel.

**_This is not a communications channel whose content will be directed by a single group or individual._**

* Any member of the community may compose a message to be tweeted and submit it through the content contribution procedures described in this guide.
* A group of volunteer reviewers examine the submitted tweets to ensure compliance with the communities' rules governing content. After a proposed tweet's content is reviewed and found to be in compliance by a number of reviewers, it is approved, then queued and tweeted by the software automatically.
* Any community member can volunteer to be a tweet content reviewer.
* Any community member may be involved in proposing, discussing and adopting the rules governing content.
* Any community member may submit as many tweets as they desire.

Such decentralization at the very heart of the Ethereum Classic community's management of its "ETC-branded" communications assets puts one of its core philosophies to work in a very public way.

# Content

Social media is a broad term for the diverse array of internet-based communications platforms that includes chat-focused sites such as Discord and Telegram, message or post-oriented feeds such as Facebook and Twitter, image-focused sites like Instagram, and a myriad of other sites each with its own unique flavor or style. The Ethereum Classic community has a presence on many of these social media platforms, some quite well established such as the Ethereum Classic Discord channel found at <https://discord.gg/ethereumclassic> others less well known.



All tweets must conform to the Twitter rules and policies found at <https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies>. Additionally;

* Dignity: No obscenities, explicit language, racism, sexism, etc.
* Neutrality: No attacking or promoting of non-ETC projects, no drama.
* Seriousness: No memes, jokes, quips, hot takes, etc.
* Accuracy: No linking to overly opinionated, biased or unverifiable information.
