*How to create and publish content to the Ethereum Classic Community's social media assets*

**Introduction**

Etherteum Classic, the original Ethereum blockchain, is governed only by the principles upon which it was founded. One of these core principles is decentralization. The Ethereum Classic Community, in an effort to decentralize control over its social media assets, to reduce the risk of having those assets hijacked by former trusted parties turned bad actors, and to encourage increased participation from the community, has adopted and refined the Twitter-Together Github action to publish content to its assets on the Twitter platform and other social media outlets.

This guide covers how content is created, reviewed, published and distributed throughout the social media outlets on which Ethereum Classic has a presence. It will provide community members with a simple, non-technical method they can use to suggest Tweets for Ethereum Classic's Twitter accounts to publish. The content creation section lists the general rules and style guidelines for the various accounts this project serves. For those interested in a deeper level of participation, the Reviewers section details the content review and approval process. No matter what your level of technical know-how, if you wish to help give voice to the Ethereum Clasic ecosystem and promote the public's awareness of all things ETC, this guide will show you how.

**Why We Twitter Together**

TThe Ethereum Classic community is no stranger to adversity. Ethereum Classic came to be during the adversity of a contentious hard-fork with which the Ethereum Foundation abandoned the core concepts of the immutable blockchain and "Code Is Law". From that abandonment, however, a wonderful thing happened. The voice of a new community arose, a community whose battlecries were the very concepts the Ethereum Foundation had forsaken.

"Immutable! Unstoppable! Decentralized! Code Is Law!"

And with that, this community of abandoned idealists took up the reins of the original Ethereum blockchain, now branded Classic, and continued on without the Ethereum Foundation.

 Since that re-beginning, the Ethereum Classic community has grown and grown stronger as they have faced test after test challenging their resolve to uphold those core concepts which brought them together. One of those tests occurred when a high-profile trusted member of the community became embittered toward the community and ETC in general. He began a campaign of disinformation in an apparent attempt to disrupt development of the Ethereum Classic project and to cause the community to feel disillusioned and defeated. He used the community's own asset, its verified Twitter account with over 60,000 followers, the keys to which had been entrusted to him and were under his control, against the community both indirectly by withholding it from use and directly by publishing content which was intended to harm rather than promote the Ethereum Classic project. As a coup-de-gras, after several failed rounds of requests that control of the account be returned to the community, this once trusted bad actor gave the account, along with its over 60,000 followers, to a competing blockchain project leaving the ETC community to start over with a newly created Twitter account, zero followers, no verification and no history.

 It is to mitigate the chances that this or something like it can happen in the future that the Twitter-Together project was begun. Many blame the bad actor for the loss of the verified Twitter accout and the long rebuilding process the community now faces. It is true that with his actions and his words, he has revealed his true character for all to see. On a deeper level, however, it is our own failure to act in accordance with our core principles that gave opportunity for this to happen at all. For whatever reason, the fact is that the Twitter account was a single point failure waiting to happen; the very antithesis of that which a community dedicated to the idea of decentralization should have allowed to exist for so long.

 With this rebuilding of its social media presence, the community will apply all it has learned through this and all the other adversities it has overcome. With a new pledge to root out centralization wherever possible and mitigate its effects where it cannot be removed, through utilizing new technology tools and multiple layers of redundancy, the Ethereum Classic community's voice will not be silenced again.
