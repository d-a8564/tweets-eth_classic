*How to create and publish content to the Ethereum Classic Community's social media assets*

**Introduction**

Etherteum Classic, the original Ethereum blockchain, is governed only by the principles upon which it was founded. One of these core principles is decentralization. The Ethereum Classic Community, in an effort to decentralize control over its social media assets, to reduce the risk of having those assets hijacked by former trusted parties turned bad actors, and to encourage increased participation from the community, has adopted and refined the Twitter-Together Github action to publish content to its assets on the Twitter platform and other social media outlets.

This guide covers how content is created, reviewed, published and distributed throughout the social media outlets on which Ethereum Classic has a presence. It will provide community members with a simple, non-technical method they can use to suggest Tweets for Ethereum Classic's Twitter accounts to publish. The content creation section lists the general rules and style guidelines for the various accounts this project serves. For those interested in a deeper level of participation, the Reviewers section details the content review and approval process. No matter what your level of technical know-how, if you wish to help give voice to the Ethereum Clasic ecosystem and promote the public's awareness of all things ETC, this guide will show you how.
